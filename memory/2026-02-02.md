## Alpaca Trading Project - Initial Build

### What Happened
Ray created #alpaca-trading channel and asked me to build an automated trading system targeting 1% daily returns on his Alpaca account.

### Key Decisions
- **Architecture:** Hybrid App + Agent Oversight (Python daemon + my cron check-ins)
- **Live trading:** Ray explicitly said NOT paper trading
- **Account:** ~$462 portfolio, only $0.20 buying power (10 existing positions)

### Built Today
- Full trading system with:
  - Momentum breakout strategy (VWAP + volume)
  - Mean reversion strategy (RSI oversold)
  - Risk manager (2% daily loss limit, 10% max position)
  - SQLite trade database
  - JSON logging
  - Market hours scheduler
  
### Current State
- Daemon running (PID 17759)
- Market closed (Sunday)
- Waiting for Monday market open to see first live trading
- Cron jobs set for 3x daily check-ins

### Blockers
- **Buying power:** Only $0.20 available - can't open new positions
- **Git:** Xcode license not accepted - can't commit changes
- **1Password in daemon:** May need manual credential injection if op CLI times out

### For Monday Morning Check-in
1. Verify daemon still running
2. Check if system detected market open
3. Watch for any trade signals (though unlikely with no buying power)
4. Consider: Should I suggest rebalancing existing positions?

### API Credentials
Stored in 1Password under "Alpaca":
- API Key: AKYN7RYAMXCPQF2JJW55HPGFES
- API Secret: (stored)
