## SecondKalshiBot Review
- **Activity**: The bot was scanning 340 markets normally until 03:49 AM, at which point logging ceased. No trades or errors were logged immediately prior to the stoppage.
- **Process Check**: No active process found for `secondkalshibot` (confirmed at 2:07 PM).

## Execution Report
- **Trades**: No trades executed today.
- **Scanning**: Healthy scanning (1-minute heartbeats) until 03:49 AM. Best opportunity found was Juventus vs Como at 101¢ (1¢ gap, no profit).

## Critical Issues
- **Bot Downtime**: The bot is currently offline and has been for over 10 hours.
- **Stall**: No explicit error was logged; the process seems to have died or been terminated.

## Activity Log (1:00 PM)
- **Hourly Git Push**: Executed successfully and pushed to origin.
- **Bot Status Check**: `secondkalshibot` is still NOT running.
- **VPN Check**: Proton VPN is NOT running. Connection check to Polymarket confirms geoblocking is active (`restricted: true` cookie).
- **Restart Attempt**: Postponed. Proton VPN CLI requires initialization/credentials which are not currently available in the environment/1Password (requires manual sign-in).

## Activity Log (1:07 PM)
- **Hourly Log Review**: Bot has been offline since 03:49 AM. Checked logs up to current time; no new activity or errors recorded since the stall. No profit events or critical errors were found in the last hour as the bot remains inactive.

## Activity Log (2:07 PM)
- **Hourly Log Review**: Bot remains offline. Logs still end at 03:49 AM. No trades or health updates to report. Process remains inactive.

## Action Items
- **VPN**: Ray needs to manually restart Proton VPN on the Mac mini (or provide instructions/credentials for CLI initialization).
- **Restart Bot**: Once VPN is active, run `projects/secondkalshibot/start.sh` to resume live trading.

## Activity Log (1:36 PM)
- **Alpaca Trading System**: Confirmed NOT RUNNING. No logs or status files for today.
- **Dashboard**: Confirmed RUNNING on port 3000 (multiple hourly checks successful).
- **ProtonVPN / Polynearexpiry**:
    - Attempted to set up containerized VPN for `poly-bot` using `gluetun`.
    - Connection failed with `AUTH_FAILED` using both existing and new credentials provided by Ray.
    - Diagnosis: Likely requires specific OpenVPN/IKEv2 credentials from the Proton account dashboard rather than standard account credentials. Containers stopped to avoid locking the account.
- **Maintenance**:
    - Scheduled 9:00 AM backup completed successfully (backup scripts run, git push successful).
    - GSPro Courses: Confirmed "Lost Island" is already on the play list.
    - Daily joke delivered at noon.
