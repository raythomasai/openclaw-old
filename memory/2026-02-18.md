## Arbitrage Bot Review (Hourly Log Review)
- **Time:** 4:08 PM
- **Logs:** Checked `projects/secondkalshibot/logs/output.log`
- **Trades:** No successful trades executed today (Feb 18). Yesterday (Feb 17), multiple attempts were made but failed due to balance and geographic restrictions.
- **Errors:** No new errors today. Bot is functioning correctly but remains limited by the same issues identified yesterday (Kalshi balance and Poly geo-block).
- **Status:** Bot is healthy and actively scanning (Heartbeats every 60s). Scanning 340 total markets (220 overlapping). Best current gap is +1¢ (101¢ cost), which is below the profit threshold.
- **Discovery:** 340 market pairs active.

## Automated Tasks
- **Hourly Git Push:** Executed at 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Successfully committed changes and pushed to origin (branch `main`).
- **Dashboard Keepalive:** Running consistently on port 3000 (Next.js). Checks at 1:45 PM, 2:45 PM, and 3:45 PM all passed without requiring a restart.

## Heartbeat Summary (4:09 PM)
- **Alpaca Trading System:** Daemon confirmed NOT RUNNING. No active process or current log file found during checks throughout the afternoon.
- **Weather:** Current status in Brookfield is clear/sunny, +58°F.
- **Project Maintenance:** Confirmed "Lost Island" already exists in GSPro courses list. Daily vision script sample generated in `am_fenrir` voice for comparison.
- **VPN Setup (Blocked):** Gluetun/ProtonVPN setup for Polymarket bot failed due to `AUTH_FAILED`. Ray needs to provide OpenVPN-specific credentials from the Proton dashboard to bypass geoblocking.
