## Arb-Bot Log Review (Hourly) - 05:00 AM CST
- **General Health**: Bot is scanning 340 markets at 1-minute intervals. Last heartbeat at 04:59 AM UTC (consistently scanning).
- **Trades**: No trades executed today.
- **Critical Issues**:
    - **Kalshi**: Insufficient balance (400 Bad Request). Persistent since Feb 17. 
    - **Polymarket**: Geoblocking (403 Forbidden - "Trading restricted in your region"). Persistent since Feb 17.
- **Notes**: Bot is scanning but "dead in the water" for execution. All attempts (last one at 10:10 PM UTC yesterday) fail immediately due to these API/regional blocks. No significant changes in status since last hour.
