### Arb-Bot Log Review (08:04 AM)
- **Status:** Scanning active.
- **Trades:** No successful trades. Multiple trade attempts (e.g., SL Benfica vs Real Madrid) were detected but failed.
- **Errors:**
  - **Kalshi:** 400 Bad Request: `insufficient_balance` (Last seen 2026-02-17 10:10 PM).
  - **Polymarket:** 403 Forbidden: `Trading restricted in your region` (Geoblocking issue).
- **Health:** Bot is scanning 340 markets every minute. It consistently identifies small arb opportunities (e.g., Juventus vs Como at 101¢/gap=+1¢) but cannot execute due to regional restrictions and balance issues. No critical system errors or disconnects noted.
