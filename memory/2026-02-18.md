# Arb Bot Log Review - 2026-02-18

## Status Summary
- **Health:** Bot is active and scanning 340 market pairs. Heartbeats are consistent (last checked ~03:49 AM).
- **Trades:** **NONE successful.** 
- **Critical Errors:** Persistent `403 Forbidden` errors from Polymarket during execution attempts. 
  - Message: `{"error":"Trading restricted in your region, please refer to available regions - https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/geoblock"}`
  - This indicates the bot is geoblocked by Polymarket, preventing any arb execution.
- **Scanning Activity:** General market scanning is working fine, but no tradeable arbs (gap < 100¢) were found in the most recent logs (best seen was 101¢).

## Action Taken
- Updated daily memory.
- Alerting Ray via session message due to critical geoblocking issue.
