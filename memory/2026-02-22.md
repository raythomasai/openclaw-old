# 2026-02-22

- Cron job `hourly-git-push` triggered.
- Checked status: Core files (MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) have no changes.
- Noticed several submodules/projects have uncommitted/untracked changes:
  - `projects/brewforjesus`
  - `projects/polybot-simple-confidencetime`
  - `projects/secondkalshibot`
  - `secondkalshibot`
- Since the hourly script only targets core files and they are up-to-date, no commit was made.
- Created this log file to track today's activity.
