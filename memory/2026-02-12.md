## Cron System Now Working
- **IMPORTANT DISCOVERY:** System events ARE working! "TEST OK" messages appearing at cron times
- The original issue was crons disappearing entirely (not just not firing)
- Re-added Bible verse (8:15 AM) and joke (noon) crons
- Agent is now responding properly to system events

## Visual Communication Setup
- Created `/Users/raythomas/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/visual_helper.py` for generating nice images with titles and bullet lists
- Updated MEMORY.md: Ray prefers IMAGES over text lists for visual communication
- Successfully sent restaurant lists and menus as images via iMessage

## Eddie Merlot's Dinner
- Sent menu as both PNG image and PDF
- Recommendations: Prime Ribeye ($69), Barbecue Shrimp ($25), Cold Water Lobster Tails ($95)

## Friday Task Added
- Article about open source AI agent framework from X (@_dominatos)
- Cron set for 9 AM Friday to check and set up X access

## Backup System Set Up (FAILED - Too Complex)
- Created `/Users/raythomas/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/backup.py` - copies key files to `/backups/`
- Created `/Users/raythomas/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/git_backup.sh` - background git push (no timeout)
- Created `/Users/raythomas/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/git_backup.py` - wrapper script
- Daily cron at 9 AM runs backup.py which then triggers git push
- **PROBLEM:** Git operations were timing out and getting stuck
- **DECISION:** Ray said to stop using system cron entirely

## Key Files for Backup
- MEMORY.md
- FUTURE_PROJECTS.md
- scripts/visual_helper.py
- scripts/backup.py
- scripts/git_backup.py
- Backups stored in `/backups/` directory

## Local Backup Location
```

## Important Rules (No Cron)
