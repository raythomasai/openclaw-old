## Voice Memo System

### Kokoro TTS Setup
- Installed Kokoro-ONNX locally (Python 3.12 venv)
- Downloaded model files to `/Users/raythomas/.openclaw/workspace/kokoro-models/`
- **bm_daniel** is Ray's preferred voice (British male) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Auto-Responder Fixes (2026-02-04 evening)
- Created `voice_memo_poller.py` that polls iMessage for new voice memos
- **Important fixes:**
  1. Remove "REPLY WITH VOICE MEMO" from the audio output (only keeps it as AI instruction)
  2. Send audio-only via iMessage (no text message alongside)
  3. Use `--file` instead of `--attachment` for imsg send
  4. Always use empty `--text ""` to prevent text from being sent
- MP3 format required for iMessage compatibility
- Runs as background process (PID 3771)

### Voice Naming Convention
- `af_*` = American female
- `am_*` = American male  
- `bf_*` = British female
- `bm_*` = **British male** (Ray's preference)

## Trading Bots

### Kalshi Bot
- Updated API endpoint to `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
- Bot running but API returning 404s

### Alpaca Trading
