## 2026-02-17 Arb-Bot Log Review (6:56 PM)

### 1. Trades Executed
- **None successful.**
- Continuous attempts (every ~10s) were made on the SL Benfica vs Real Madrid market from ~9:45 PM to ~10:10 PM UTC (~3:45 PM to ~4:10 PM CST). All failed.

### 2. Errors & Disconnects
- **Kalshi Error (Recurring):** `400 Bad Request: {"error":{"code":"insufficient_balance",...}}`.
- **Polymarket Error (Recurring):** `403 Forbidden: {"error":"Trading restricted in your region",...}`.
- **Bot Behavior:** The bot is stuck in a loop attempting to execute an arb that it cannot fulfill due to these persistent errors. It does not appear to have logic to "blackhole" a failing market after repeated failures.

### 3. General Health/Scanning
- **Scanning:** Active. Discovery found 102 new market pairs earlier today (340 total pairs in cache).
- **Heartbeat:** Healthy and regular (every ~1 minute).
- **Execution Logic:** The bot is correctly identifying opportunities (gap of -2¢ on Benfica vs Madrid) but is failing at the API level for both legs.

### Summary
The bot is in an "execution loop" for a Benfica vs Madrid arb it cannot fulfill due to **funding (Kalshi)** and **geoblocking (Polymarket)**. It remains healthy in terms of scanning, but these errors are spamming the log. No critical system disconnects found.
