## 2026-02-17 Arb-Bot Log Review (5:55 PM)

### 1. Trades Executed
- **None successful.**
- Several attempts were made (e.g., SL Benfica vs Real Madrid), but all failed due to balance and geographic restrictions.

### 2. Errors & Disconnects
- **Kalshi Error:** `400 Bad Request: insufficient balance`. The bot attempted trades but lacked the necessary funds on Kalshi.
- **Polymarket Error:** `403 Forbidden: Trading restricted in your region`. This indicates a geoblock issue preventing Polymarket execution.
- **Cache Warning:** `Could not load neg_risk cache` (minor/initialization).

### 3. General Health/Scanning
- **Scanning:** Active and healthy. The bot is successfully discovering and matching markets (340 pairs total).
- **Heartbeat:** Regular updates show the bot is constantly calculating the "Best" arb opportunities (e.g., Juventus vs Como at 101¢).
- **Mode:** Running in **LIVE EXECUTION** mode.

### Summary
The bot is functionally healthy in terms of scanning and logic but is currently unable to execute trades due to **funding (Kalshi)** and **geographic restrictions (Polymarket)**. No critical system crashes or disconnects were found.
