# Arb-Bot Log Review - 2026-02-17

- **Status**: Healthy / Scanning
- **Markets Tracked**: 340
- **Connectivity**: 
    - Kalshi: Connected (Subscribed to 340 markets)
    - Polymarket: Connected (Subscribed to 680 tokens)
- **Trades**: None executed. 
- **Activity**: The bot is actively scanning and reporting heartbeats every minute.
- **Best Opportunity Found**: Barcelona vs Levante (Winner?) at 101¢ (P_yes 88¢ + K_no 12¢ + 1¢ fee), representing a +1¢ gap, which is above the current 100¢ threshold but likely hasn't triggered execution due to specific arb-bot internal logic or insufficient spread.
- **Errors**: 
    - `WARN`: Mode is LIVE EXECUTION (standard notification).
    - `WARN`: Could not load neg_risk cache (non-critical, first run behavior).
    - No disconnects or critical errors found in the last hour of logs.
