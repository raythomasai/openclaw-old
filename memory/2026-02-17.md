## arb-bot review (20:56)
- **Status**: Active and scanning.
- **Activity**: Monitoring ~340 market pairs. 
- **Trades**: 0 successful trades.
- **Errors**: 
  - Significant cluster of execution failures around 21:30 - 22:10 UTC today.
  - **Kalshi**: Returning "insufficient balance" (400 Bad Request).
  - **Polymarket**: Returning "Trading restricted in your region" (403 Forbidden).
  - These errors repeat rapidly when an arb opportunity is detected (e.g., Benfica vs Real Madrid), suggesting the bot is trying to execute but failing on both sides.
