# Arb-bot Log Review - 2026-02-17 15:54

## 1. Trades Executed
- **None.** Attempted trades for "SL Benfica vs Real Madrid" (25x) consistently failed.

## 2. Errors/Disconnects
- **CRITICAL: execution loop failure.**
- **Kalshi Error:** `400 Bad Request: insufficient_balance`. The account needs funding.
- **Polymarket Error:** `403 Forbidden: Trading restricted in your region`. This is a geoblock issue.
- **Loop Spam:** The bot is stuck in a tight retry loop (every 10 seconds) attempting the same failing trade, which will likely lead to rate limiting or account flags.

## 3. General Health
- **Scanning:** Active. Found 340 market pairs across multiple leagues (EPL, Bundesliga, LaLiga, etc.).
- **Connectivity:** Heartbeats are active, but execution is completely blocked by balance and regional restrictions.

**Recommendation:** Halt the bot to stop error spam and resolve regional/balance issues.
