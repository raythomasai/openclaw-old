    - **Kalshi**: `insufficient_balance` (Error 400).
    - **Polymarket**: `Trading restricted in your region` (Error 403 / Geoblocked).
- **Opportunity**: The bot is identifying opportunities (e.g., Juventus vs Como), but they currently fall short of the profit threshold (Gap: +1¢ vs Threshold: 100¢/arb).

## Errors
