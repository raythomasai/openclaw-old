## Shazam for PowerPoint Slides

**Concept:** Point your phone at any presentation slide (or upload a screenshot) and instantly find:
- The original presentation/slide deck
- Author/source attribution
- Full context and surrounding slides
- Related/derivative presentations
- Licensing info (creative commons, purchased, etc.)

**How it works:**
1. **Image capture** - Camera upload or screenshot
2. **Computer vision** - Extract text, charts, diagrams, images
3. **Reverse search** - Match against indexed presentations
4. **Results** - Link to original source, similar slides, citations

**Data sources:**
- SlideShare, Google Slides, OneDrive
- Academic presentations ( universities, conferences)
- Corporate decks (with permission)
- Creative Commons licensed content
- YouTube talks (extract frames)

**Monetization:**
- Freemium: 5 free searches/month
- Pro: $4.99/month unlimited + export features
- Enterprise: API access for companies to track their deck usage
- Affiliate: Link to purchase templates/slides

**Competitors:**
- Pinterest Visual Search (kind of)
- Google Lens (generic)
- No dedicated "slides only" solution found

**Tech stack:**
- OCR (Tesseract, Google Vision)
- Reverse image search (image embeddings)
- Database: vector DB for slide embeddings
- Web index of millions of presentations

**Name ideas:**
- SlideShazam
- DeckID
- SlideMatch
- FindMySlide
- DeckFinder
